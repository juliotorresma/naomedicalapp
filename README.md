## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a web-based translator application that allows users to input text and receive translations in their desired language. The application consists of a frontend built with modern web technologies and a backend REST API responsible for handling the translation logic.

## 2. Web Application (Frontend)

The frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the translator service.

### 2.1. Technologies Used

* **Framework/Library:** React
* **Bundler:** Vite
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** CSS (potentially with a CSS-in-JS library or a preprocessor like Sass/Less - specify if used)
* **State Management:** (e.g., useState, useContext, Redux, Zustand - specify if used)
* **HTTP Client:** (e.g., fetch API, Axios - specify if used)

### 2.2. Project Setup

The frontend project was initialized using Vite. The following steps were taken:

1.  **Project Initialization:** Used Vite's CLI to scaffold the React TypeScript project:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest translator-app -- --template react-ts
    cd translator-app
    ```
2.  **Dependency Installation:** Installed necessary dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (List any other significant dependencies installed, e.g., UI libraries, state management libraries, HTTP clients)
3.  **Project Structure:** Organized the project files into the following structure (as seen in the file explorer):
    ```
    translator-app/
    ├── public/
    │   └── ... (static assets)
    ├── src/
    │   ├── assets/
    │   │   └── ... (images, fonts, etc.)
    │   ├── components/
    │   │   └── ... (reusable UI components)
    │   ├── pages/
    │   │   └── main-page.tsx (main translator interface)
    │   ├── App.css
    │   ├── App.tsx
    │   ├── index.css
    │   ├── main.tsx (entry point)
    │   └── ... (other frontend logic)
    ├── index.html
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    ├── tsconfig.app.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── tsconfig.node.json
    └── vite.config.ts
    ```
4.  **Vite Configuration:** Configured `vite.config.ts` for development server settings, build optimizations, and potentially proxying API requests during development.

### 2.3. Core Features Development

The development of the core translator functionality involved:

1.  **User Interface Design:** Created the layout and design of the `main-page.tsx` component, including input fields for the text to be translated, dropdowns or selection mechanisms for choosing source and target languages, and a display area for the translated text.
2.  **Language Selection:** Implemented the logic for handling source and target language selection. This might involve fetching a list of supported languages from the backend API or using a predefined list on the frontend.
3.  **Text Input Handling:** Implemented event handlers to capture and manage the text entered by the user in the input field.
4.  **API Integration:** Integrated the frontend with the backend REST API to send translation requests and receive the translated text. This likely involved using the `fetch` API or a library like Axios to make POST requests to the appropriate API endpoint.
5.  **Displaying Results:** Implemented the logic to display the translated text received from the API in the designated output area of the UI.
6.  **Error Handling:** Implemented basic error handling to catch potential issues during API requests (e.g., network errors, invalid input) and provide feedback to the user.

### 2.4. UI Components

Reusable UI components were created within the `components/` directory to build the translator interface. These components might include:

* `InputField`: For users to enter text.
* `LanguageDropdown`: For selecting source and target languages.
* `Button`: To trigger the translation request.
* `OutputArea`: To display the translated text.
* (List any other significant reusable components)

### 2.5. State Management (if applicable)

(Describe how state was managed in the frontend application. For example:)

* **`useState` and `useContext`:** For managing local component state and sharing state across components.
* **Redux:** Implemented a Redux store to manage application-wide state, actions, and reducers for handling language selection, input text, and translation results.
* **Zustand:** Utilized Zustand for a simpler state management solution.

### 2.6. Building the Application

To prepare the frontend for deployment, the following command was used:

```bash
npm run build
